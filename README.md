This example demonstrates a common error in VBScript related to implicit returns in functions.  When a function doesn't explicitly assign a value to its name in all execution paths, VBScript's behavior is not always intuitive. This can cause unexpected results, particularly when dealing with conditional statements. The solution clarifies the return value by explicitly assigning a value to the function name in all cases.
